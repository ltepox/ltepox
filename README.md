My name is Luis Tepox 
Iâ€™m currently working on my masters degree at California State University Los Angeles in âš¡Electrical Engineeringâš¡ with an emphasis in Communications :satellite:.

I am interested in working on embedded systems at the moment for this class because during my undergraduate degree I was interested in coding but at the time didn't wish to pursue it since many of my friends said it was difficult. But I am interested now because of all the advantages it has and embedded systems is everywhere wether it is your phone :iphone:, computer :computer:, or other daily electronic systems.

I have several hobbies at the moment. During Covid I explored different thigns I wanted to do once we were able to go out. One of my hobies is cycling :bike: in which I do around where I live either on the park or ride long distance. Another hobby I have currently is indoor rock climbing :climbing:, I get tired when doing this hobby since it involves your forearm and shoulders but honestly fun to do. There are many routes that are still quite difficult but still working on it to get better at it. 

I am also working at Cummins Inc. as a Systems Engineer where I mostly use MATLAB and Simulink but want to go to another field of industry since I want to explore the different opportunities when working in Communications :satellite: or RF Engineering :speaker:. I also work as a tutor :teacher: on the side since I have been tutoring for a very long time and enjoy it quite a lot specifically in Math.
